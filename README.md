**Jerrod Willbrandt<br/>
CS Major<br/>
Southern New Hampshire University<br/>**

# **Introduction**
My name is Jerrod Willbrandt, and this is my final project to complete for my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Southern New Hampshire Univerisity.  My college career started back in 2008 at Kellogg Community College, but I took quite a few years off to figure out exactly what I wanted to do.  I have attended SNHU for the past 3 years and have learned a lot.  This is my ePortfolio containing ehnanced artifacts from courses & coursework over my last 3 years of schooling.

# **Professional Self-Assessment**
Throughout the entire Computer Science program, I have learned many things that have helped advance my strenghts and professional goals.  The artifacts below will showcase my work and demostrate how far I have come since the beginning of the program.  This project has allowed me to revisit some of my old projects from up to 3 years ago when I was just starting out.  As you will see, I learned how to enhance my 3D visualization model, build a short mad lib with user entered data, and how to build a database in SQL.  These artifacts will help me in the professional field because they showcase the wide range of knowledge I have learned during my schooling as well as my ability to improve.

While working on certain projects, I needed to colaborate and work with other peers to get things done.  One thing I've learned is using a cloud based system when working with others is very useful because it allows all team members to work simultaniously and see the work progress.  Communicating with stakeholders is a big part of working on a project because you have to keep them in the loop and discuss changes with them so projects can get done right and in a timely fashion.  Data structures and algorithms are fun to work with because they allow you the chance to build things from scratch as you want to see them.  Software engineering and database work is also something I enjoy doing, especially creating databases.  The world is driven by data, so we need to keep all that information secure and readily accessible by creating databases.  Security is always important because we have to protect what we have and what we have created.

Artifact one showcases my ability to take a multi-colored 3D visualization, add a background image to the object, change the background color, and make the object rotate on it's axis.  This is an OpenGL 3D Pyramid project that was created in the Eclipse IDE.  This project fits into my ePortfolio because it shows the enhancements I was able to make to an already existing project and create a moving object.

Artifact two asks a user to enter data based on a few questions, stores that data in an array, and then calls back on it later.  After ther user has answered all the questions, the program prints out a 'mad lib' with data that was entered in by the user.  This project fits into my ePortfolio by showing my ability to create an array with user entered data and call back on it in a simple program.

Artifact three is a complete ground up creation of a family tree database based on information from my family.  It showcases my ability to create a database, enter values into it, update the tables as needed, and join different columns from multiple tables.  

# **Artifact Code Review**
The first part of this project was to figure out what artifacts/projects I would use and how to enhance them.  From there I created a short video explaining what projects I was working on and how I was going to enhance them.  Below is that video.

# **Software Design and Engineering**
[Project Files](https://github.com/JerrodTWillSNHU/ePortfolio/tree/master/Pyramid) for **Artifact One** can be found here.

The artifact for Software and Engineering is a Pyramid created in Eclipse using the language C++ modern OpenGL which I created using the program Eclipse.  The point of this project was to create a 3D pyramid with a color scheme.  The Pyramid has multiple colors, isn’t very big, leans on a bit of an angle, and doesn’t move/rotate at all.  I created this project back in November of 2019.  

I selected this project because I remember having fun in this course as well as being very challenged.  In completing this course, I remember feeling very accomplished.  The specifics of this project I would like to highlight the color scheme of the pyramid, as well as the even shape and angles of it all.  In the improvements I’ve changed from a color scheme to a texture, increased the size of the Pyramid, and added a rotation to the Pyramid on a axis.

What I learned from this enhancement is I really enjoyed designing 3D objects during that particular course.  I also learned that just because it has been a while since I worked with a specific language that it is kind of like riding a bike in the sense that it comes back to me.  The challenges I faced were adding in the light, which is why I didn’t go with it.  I felt as though I made enough enhancements that I didn’t need to add the light and I am happy with the outcome.

# **Algorithm and Data Structures**
[Project Files](https://github.com/JerrodTWillSNHU/ePortfolio/tree/master/ArtifactTwo) for **Artifact Two** can be found here.

The artifact I have created for Algorithms and Data Structure is a personal & mad lib array in C++.  The program asks a user for some personal information, stores that information in an array, and then pulls the information out into a mad lib I’ve created.  This is a project I have created from scratch and reflects my learning from previous coding courses at SNHU.  This program was created on July 22nd, 2020.

Arrays are a very important part of data structure, which is why I have created an array program to include as an artifact in my ePortfolio.  I’ve selected it because I am comfortable with C++ and wanted to use some creativity with the array using tricks I’ve learned over the years.  Specific parts of the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities are the mad lib.  The mad lib pulls the users name, favorite color, and sum of favorite numbers that were provided at the beginning of the program, and then adds in adjectives and nouns entered in by the user to create a mad lib.

I’m happy to say after figuring out what I wanted to do I was able to create the array project and feel comfortable with what I have done.
The project was build from scratch and memory of things I’ve learned over the years at SNHU.  It is the perfect artifact to showcase an array data structure.  It was not an enhancement of a previous project, but a creating of and idea I wanted to pursue.  The challenges I faced in this project were getting the spacing right, making sure all of the variables were properly named, and getting the data to pull to the right places.

# **Databases**
[Project Files](https://github.com/JerrodTWillSNHU/ePortfolio/tree/master/SQLFamilyDatabase) for **Artifact Three** can be found here.

The artifact I have chosen for the database category is the creation of a Family Tree Database in SQL.  The database contains real information about my immediate and extended family.  I created this database at the beginning of this course to show my skills and proficiency using SQL.

This database is a great addition to my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my knowledge in using SQL to create a database using tables, shows, and joins.  I selected this artifact because it is always better to create things from your direct knowledge, and I know about my family.  The specific components of this artifact that showcase my skills and abilities are the creation of three tables, inserting data into the tables, updating columns and values in tables, and using the JOIN function to merge certain parts of the tables.

I created an entirely new database from memory and scratch to showcase my skills using SQL in database.  I didn’t necessarily learn anything from creating this database, but I sharpened my skills in using SQL which is what I sat out to do.  The challenges I faced were using the correct JOIN functions to merge certain parts of the tables I wanted.

# **Conclusion**
This concludes my ePortfolio which showcases my skills and what I have learned over the last three years at SNHU.  The artifacts include learnings of C++, SQL, data structures, arrays, the use of IDE's, and enhancements to previous projects of mine.  Thank you for taking the time to look over my ePortfolio.
