CS Major<br/>

# **Introduction**
My name is Jerrod Willbrandt, and this is my final project to complete for my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Southern New Hampshire Univerisity.  My college career started back in 2008 at Kellogg Community College, but I took quite a few years off to figure out exactly what I wanted to do.  I have attended SNHU for the past 3 years and have learned a lot.  This is my ePortfolio containing ehnanced artifacts from courses & coursework over my last 3 years of schooling.

# **Professional Self-Assessment**
Throughout the entire Computer Science program, I have learned many things that have helped advance my strenghts and professional goals.  The artifacts below will showcase my work and demostrate how far I have come since the beginning of the program.  This project has allowed me to revisit some of my old projects from up to 3 years ago when I was just starting out.  As you will see, I learned how to enhance my 3D visualization model, build a short mad lib with user entered data, and how to build a database in SQL.  These artifacts will help me in the professional field because they showcase the wide range of knowledge I have learned during my schooling as well as my ability to improve.

While working on certain projects, I needed to colaborate and work with other peers to get things done.  One thing I've learned is using a cloud based system when working with others is very useful because it allows all team members to work simultaniously and see the work progress.  Communicating with stakeholders is a big part of working on a project because you have to keep them in the loop and discuss changes with them so projects can get done right and in a timely fashion.  Data structures and algorithms are fun to work with because they allow you the chance to build things from scratch as you want to see them.  Software engineering and database work is also something I enjoy doing, especially creating databases.  The world is driven by data, so we need to keep all that information secure and readily accessible by creating databases.  Security is always important because we have to protect what we have and what we have created.

Artifact one showcases my ability to take a multi-colored 3D visualization, add a background image to the object, change the background color, and make the object rotate on it's axis.  This is an OpenGL 3D Pyramid project that was created in the Eclipse IDE.  This project fits into my ePortfolio because it shows the enhancements I was able to make to an already existing project and create a moving object.

Artifact two asks a user to enter data based on a few questions, stores that data in an array, and then calls back on it later.  After ther user has answered all the questions, the program prints out a 'mad lib' with data that was entered in by the user.  This project fits into my ePortfolio by showing my ability to create an array with user entered data and call back on it in a simple program.

Artifact three is a complete ground up creation of a family tree database based on information from my family.  It showcases my ability to create a database, enter values into it, update the tables as needed, and join different columns from multiple tables.  

# **Artifact Code Review**
The first part of this project was to figure out what artifacts/projects I would use and how to enhance them.  From there I created a short video explaining what projects I was working on and how I was going to enhance them.  Below is that video.
