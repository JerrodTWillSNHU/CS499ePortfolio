CS Major<br/>
Southern New Hampshire University<br/>**

# **Introduction:**
My name is Jerrod Willbrandt, and this is my final project to complete for my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Southern New Hampshire Univerisity.  My college career started back in 2008 at Kellogg Community College, but I took quite a few years off to figure out exactly what I wanted to do.  I have attended SNHU for the past 3 years and have learned a lot.  This is my ePortfolio containing ehnanced artifacts from courses & coursework over my last 3 years of schooling.
