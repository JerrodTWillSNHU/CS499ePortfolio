># **Introduction:**
My name is Jerrod Willbrandt, and this is my final project to complete for my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Southern New Hampshire Univerisity.  My college career started back in 2008 at Kellogg Community College, but I took quite a few years off to figure out exactly what I wanted to do.  I have attended SNHU for the past 3 years and have learned a lot.  This is my ePortfolio containing ehnanced artifacts from courses & coursework over my last 3 years of schooling.

># **Artifact Code Review**
>The first part of this project was to figure out what artifacts/projects I would use and how to enhance them.  From there I created a short video explaining what projects I was working on and how I was going to enhance them.  Below is that video.
